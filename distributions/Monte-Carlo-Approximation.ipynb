    "# Monte Carlo Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "How to compute the distribution of a function of an random variable $X$? One powerful approach is as follows: first we generate $S$ samples from the distribution, calling them $x_1,\\ldots x_S$. Given the samples, we can approximate the distribution of $f(X)$ by using the empirical distribution of $\\{f(x_s)\\}_{s=1}^S$. This is called a **Monte Carlo** approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Monte Carlo to approximate the *expected value* of any function of a random variable. This involves simply drawing samples and computing the arithmetic mean of the function applied to the samples:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[f(X)] = \\int f(x)p(x)dx\\approx \\frac{1}{S}\\sum_{s=1}^S f(x_s),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $x_s\\sim p(X)$. This is called Monte Carlo integration. It has the advantage over numerical integration (which is based on evaluating the function at a fixed grid of points) that the function is only evaluated in places where there is non-negligible probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By varying $f$, we can compute many quantities of interest, such as \n",
    "* $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{S}\\sum_{s=1}^S x_s \\rightarrow \\mathbb{E}[X]$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\frac{1}{S}\\sum_{s=1}^S(x_s - \\bar{x})^2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{var}[X]$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\frac{1}{S}|\\{x_s \\le c\\}| \\rightarrow P(X\\le C)$\n",
    "\n",
    "* median $\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_s\\} \\rightarrow(X)$"
