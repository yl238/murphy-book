    "The beta-binomial distribution arises when we have the probability of success in $n$ Bernoulli trials is either unknown or random. The beta-binomial is the binomial distribution in which the probability of success at each of $n$ trials is not fixed but randomly drawn from a Beta distribution.\n",
