    "In this question, we will demonstrate the relationship between mutual information and entropy. Before starting the solution, remember that the **mutual information** between two random variables is a **more general way of measuring the relationship between them** than the correlation coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **entropy is a measure of uncertainty**. Thus, we expect two situations. Either the mutual information is zero, and the conditional entropy does not change, or the mutual information is positive and the conditional entropy is less than the prior entropy. In another words, the mutual information is a measure of how the knowledge of one random variable takes away the uncertainty of the other random variable."
