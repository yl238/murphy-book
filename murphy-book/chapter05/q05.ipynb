    "## Exercise 5.5 Newsvendor problem\n",
    "Consider the following classic problem in decision theory/ economics. Suppose you are trying to decide how much quantity $Q$ of some product (e.g., newspapers) to buy to maximize your profits. The optimal amount will depend on how much demand $D$ you think there is for your product, as well as its cost to you $C$ and its selling price $P$. Suppose $D$ is unknown but has pdf $f(D)$ and cdf $F(D)$. We can evaluate the expected profit by considering two cases: if $D > Q$, then we sell all $Q$ items, and make profit $π = (P −C)Q$; but if $D < Q$, we only sell $D$ items, at profit $(P −C)D$, but have wasted $C(Q−D)$ on the unsold items. So the expected profit if we buy quantity $Q$ is\n",
