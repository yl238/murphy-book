    "What this says is that the MLE is the sample average of our dataset, which makes sense since the expected value of the Poisson distribution is equal to $\\lambda$. Remember by the law of large numbers, the sample average converges almost surely to the expected value, which means that if we have a lot of points in our dataset, our MLE is a good estimator for the parameter of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regards the details of the optimisation, since $\\lambda>0$ by definition and the log-likelihood is a function of $\\lambda$ that starts out increasing (while $\\log(\\lambda)$ is more relevant than $-N\\lambda$). then decreases indefinitely (when $-N\\lambda$ becomes more relevant than $\\log(\\lambda)$), we have certainty that the MLE gives us a global maximum."
