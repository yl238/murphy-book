    "## Exercise 3.13 Posterior predictive distribution for a batch of data with the dirichlet-multinomial model\n",
    "In Equation 3.51, we gave the the posterior predictive distribution for a single multinomial trial using a dirichlet prior. Now consider predicting a batch of new data, $D = (X_1,\\dots,X_m)$, consisting of $m$ single multinomial trials (think of predicting the next m words in a sentence, assuming they are drawn iid). Derive an expression for $p(\\tilde{D}|D, Î±)$.\n",

This is a straightforward math question, that will follow the same pattern as the previous posterior predictives as we saw before. Nevertheless, there is easier and hard ways to arrive at the results. We will see two easy ways to arrive at the final expression.\n",
