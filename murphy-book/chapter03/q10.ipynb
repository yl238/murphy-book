    "## Exercise 3.10 Taxicab (tramcar) problem\n",
    "Suppose you arrive in a new city and see a taxi numbered 100. How many taxis are there in this city? Let us assume taxis are numbered sequentially as integers starting from 0, up to some unknown upper bound $\\theta$. (We number taxis from 0 for simplicity; we can also count from 1 without changing the analysis.) Hence the likelihood function is $p(x) = U(0,\\theta)$, the uniform distribution. The goal is to estimate $\\theta$. We will use the Bayesian analysis from Exercise 3.9."
