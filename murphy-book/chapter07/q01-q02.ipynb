    "## Exercise 7.1 Behavior of training set error with increasing sample size\n",
    "The error on the test will always decrease as we get more training data, since the model will be better estimated. However, as shown in Figure 7.10, for sufficiently complex models, the error on the training set can increase we we get more training data, until we reach some plateau. Explain why."

    "### Solution\n",
    "When the model is sufficiently complex and there is little training data, the model is 'memorizing' the training data, so the training error is very small. As the amount of training data increases, the model is now starting to learn from the data, therefore the error starts to increase. Eventually the error is limited by the quality of the model."
