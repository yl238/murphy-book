# Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective

This repository contains jupyter notebooks and scripts written to better understand
probabilistic modelling. Many of the notes were from Murphy's 
'Machine Learning - a probabilistic perspective', but some are also from Bishop (2006) 
and other resources when Murphy's book is less than explicit.


To keep myself up-to-date I have included some notes I made on the 'more' recent papers on 
stochastic variational inference. 

I've implemented some of the algorithms and you can find them in the corresponding directories: 
- Expectation-Maximisation algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models (`mixture-models-and-em`) 


Finally, some probabilistic programming libraries:
- The `Pyro` directory contains examples using the Python library Pyro for inference.
- The `TFP` directory contains examples using the Tensorflow Probability library.
